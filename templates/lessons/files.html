<p>In this lesson, we'll learn how to make our programs read and write files. This is very important if you want to let users open and save files with your program.</p>
<p>We use <em>File Pointers</em> to talk about files like variables.</p>
<pre><code>FILE *r_file, *w_file;
</code></pre>	</section>

<h2>Opening an Closing Files</h2>
<p>We open files with <em><code>fopen()</code></em> and close them with <em><code>fclose()</code></em> when we've finished using them:</p>
<pre><code>r_file = fopen("Readable.txt", "r");
w_file = fopen("Writeable.txt", "w");
...
fclose(r_file);
fclose(w_file);
</code></pre>
<p><code>fopen()</code> has 2 parameters: The file name and the <em>file permission</em>. The file permission tells our program what we can do with the file. There are six options:</p>
<ul>
<li>"r" - Open a file for reading. The file must exist.</li>
<li>"w" - Create an empty file for writing. If the file already exists it is erased before writing.</li>
<li>"a" - Append to a file. Writing operations append data at the end of the file. The file is created if it does not exist.</li>
<li>"r+" - Open a file for update both reading and writing. The file must exist.</li>
<li>"w+" - Create an empty file for both reading and writing.</li>
<li>"a+" - Open a file for reading and appending.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's also very important to check that your file opened correctly. If it did not, it will cause an error later. To prevent errors, we will close the program with <code>exit()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>r_file = fopen("Readable.txt", "r");
if(r_file==NULL) {
    printf("Cannot open file.");
    exit(0);
}
</code></pre>	</section>

<h2>File I/O</h2>
<p>We use <em><code>fgets()</code></em> to read from a file, and <em><code>fprintf()</code></em> to write to the file.</p>
<pre><code>fgets(string,1000, r_file); // file -&gt; string
fprintf(w_file, "Hello File!");
</code></pre>
<p><code>for</code> Loops are The Right Tool for The Job when you want to read/write a file or work with an array.</p>
<pre><code>for(i=0; !feof(r_file); i++)
    fgets(line[i], 1000, r_file);
</code></pre>
<p>The function <em><code>feof()</code></em> tells us if we are at <code>EOF</code> (End Of File).</p>
<p>There are a number of other File I/O functions you may find useful: (For <code>fread()</code> and <code>fwrite()</code> you need to know how pointers work)</p>
<ul>
<li><code>char fgetc(FILE *f)</code> - This function reads the next character of the file.</li>
<li><code>fputc(char c, FILE *f)</code> - This function writes one letter to the file.</li>
<li><code>fread(void *ptr, int size, int num_members, FILE *f)</code> - Reads the whole file and stores it ptr.</li>
<li><code>fwrite(void *ptr, int size, int num_members, FILE *f)</code> - Writes the values pointed to by ptr to the file.</li>
<li><code>rewind(FILE *f)</code> - Rewinds to the beginning of the file.</li>
</ul>	</section>
