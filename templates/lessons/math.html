<h2>Basic Math Operators</h2>

<p>Math in C looks a lot like the math you use everyday. You can use the operators +, -, * and / to solve math problems. The result of a math equation can be assigned to a variable or passed to a function:</p>

<div class="code">int result = (2+4)*3/4;
int age = 22;
printf("Half your age is : %d.\n", age/2);
</div>

<p>The <span class="keyword">Modulus operator</span> "%" can be used to calculate the Remainder of a division equation.</p>

<div class="code">14 / 10 == 1 		14 % 10 == 4
24 / 10 == 2 		24 % 10 == 4
2764 / 10 == 276 	2764 % 10 == 4
</div>

<p>The <span class="keyword">Increment operator</span> "++" can be used to add one to a variable. The <span class="keyword">Decrement operator</span> "--" is the opposite, it subtracts one from a variable</p>

<div class="code">int age = 22;
age++;
age == 23
age--;
age == 22
</div>
