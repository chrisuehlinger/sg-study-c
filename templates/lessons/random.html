<p>If you want to make a program that involves chance (like a dice or card game, or a game with a computer player) you will need to use <em>random numbers</em>. The function <em><code>rand()</code></em> creates a Random number between 0 and 32767 (2^15 - 1).</p>
<div id="rand-no-bound" class="code">//Creates a number between 0 and 32767
int number = rand();
number -> <span class="rand">1</span>
</div>

<p>Random numbers are great for making games on the computer. They are used for things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generating Random events (Pokemon in the wild)</li>
<li>Controlling Enemy AI (First Person Shooters)</li>
<li>Procedurally Generated Maps (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ4FRcu_bjs">FTL:Faster Than Light</a> and Minecraft)</li>
</ul>	</section>

<h2>Getting the number we want</h2>
<p>We don't usually want a number as big as 30000, so we can use a math formula to get the numbers we want. We will need to use the Modulo Operator '%' to make the numbers smaller.</p>
<div id="rand-bound-100" class="code">//Creates a number between 0 and 99
int number = rand() % 100;
number -> <span class="rand">1</span>
</div>

<p>What if we want numbers between 50 and 100? We need to start thinking about our <em>minimum</em>, <em>maximum</em> and <em>range</em>. Here is the formula we will use:</p>
<div class="code">int range = (max - min) + 1;
int random = (rand() % range) + min;</div>

<p>So if we want random numbers between 50 and 100, we would do this:</p>
<div id="rand-50-100"class="code">//Creates a number between 50 and 100
int range = (100 - 50) + 1;
int number = (rand() % range) + 50; // (rand() % 51) + 50
number -> <span class="rand">51</span>
</div>

<p>So if I wanted to get a random number between 1 and 6, I could write this function:</p>
<div id="dice" class="code">//Creates a number between 1 and 6
int range = (6 - 1) + 1;
int dice = (rand() % range) + 1; // (rand() % 6) + 1
dice -> <span class="rand">1</span>
</div>	</section>

<h2>Random Seed</h2>
<p>If you use <code>rand()</code> in your program, it will generate the same random numbers every time you run the program. Usually, this is not what you want. If you want <code>rand()</code> to make different numbers every time you run the program, you must give it a different seed number every time you run. We can set the seed value with the <code>srand()</code> function:</p>
<div id="dice" class="code">srand(seed);</div>

<p>A good seed to use is the time, because it will be different every time you run the program. Here is a program with that uses <code>srand()</code> and the <code>time()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#include&lt;stdlib.h&gt; //For rand() and srand()
#include&lt;time.h&gt; //For time()

main() {
    // time(NULL) returns the time right now
    srand(time(NULL));

    // Creates a number between 1 and 6
    int dice = (rand() % 6) + 1
}
</code></pre>	</section>
