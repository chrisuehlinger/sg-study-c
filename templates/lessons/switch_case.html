<p>Sometimes, a long chain of <code>if</code>-<code>else</code>-<code>if</code> statements is not the best way to solve a problem. We saw this with the necktie problem:</p>
<p>I have one necktie for each day of the week. I need a program to tell me which tie to wear each day.</p>
<p>Here is how we could solve the problem using <code>if</code>-<code>else</code>-<code>if</code> statements:</p>
<pre><code>day = getchar();
if(day == 'M')
    printf("Today you should wear a Yellow tie!");
else if(day == 'T')
    printf("Today you should wear a Pink tie!");
else if(day == 'W')
    printf("Today you should wear a Green tie!");
else if(day == 'R')
    printf("Today you should wear an Orange tie!");
else if(day == 'F')
    printf("Today you should wear a Blue tie!");
else
    printf("Today you should wear No tie!");
</code></pre>
<p>When we have to answer a question with Two possible answers (True or False, Yes or No, Right or Wrong, etc.) <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> statements are a good idea. Sometimes we even need to have many <code>if</code> statements. However, sometimes it is easier to write a <em><code>switch-case</code> statement</em> to help solve the problem:</p>
<pre><code>day = getchar();
printf("Today you should wear ");
switch(day)
{
    case 'm':
    case 'M': printf("a Yellow "); break;
    case 't':
    case 'T': printf("a Pink "); break;
    case 'w':
    case 'W': printf("a Green "); break;
    case 'r':
    case 'R': printf("an Orange "); break;
    case 'f':
    case 'F': printf("a Blue "); break;
    default: printf("No "); break;
}
printf("Tie! Have a nice day!");
</code></pre>
<p>A <em><code>switch</code> statement</em> takes a variable as input (although Strings will not work, because they are Arrays) and uses it to choose which <code>case</code> statement to run. It runs the code starting at the <em><code>case</code> statement</em> and ending at the next <em><code>break</code> statement</em>. If none of the <code>case</code> statements are correct, it will run the code the comes after the <em><code>default</code> statement</em>.</p></p>	</section>
